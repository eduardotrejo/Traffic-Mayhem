# Traffic Mayhem

<p>Traffic Mayhem is my attempt to create the classic game Frogger, it will be a simplified version of the game. The gameâ€™s genre can be classified as an overhead action game.</p>

<b>Created by Eduardo Trejo </b>

<b>Contents Needed:</b>
* Background music
* Sound effects for the player and enemies 
* Image files for the player, cars, stage, objects/hazards, and backgrounds

<p>The game will consist of 2 levels and a good amount of cars and obstacles to go through. If the player gets hit by a car or encounters other obstacles, the player will reset to the starting position. The player will have 3 lives to attempt each level.</p>
