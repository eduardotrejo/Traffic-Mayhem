# Traffic Mayhem

<p>Traffic Mayhem is my attempt to create the classic game Frogger, it will be a simplified version of the game. The gameâ€™s genre can be classified as an overhead action game.</p>

<b>Created by Eduardo Trejo </b>

<p>The contents needed for the game are: background music and sound effects for the player and enemies. It will also use image files for the player, cars, stage, objects/hazards, and backgrounds.</p>
